# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was your motivation?
This webpage will serve as a study guide for the entirety of the UNC Charlotte Part-Time Bootcamp to track notes and key points. It will continually be updated as information begins to flow in.
Learning the foundational elements of JavaScript and Web Development are critical in learning the more advanced topcis or other languages. 

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
There are many critical aspects in web development and a lot of information to keep track of. It is more useful to create a webpage and follow the Github flow when taking/adding notes rather than storing notes in MS Word. Each time you add notes will be practice.

- What problem does it solve?
This webpage will act as a cental repository for all notes in the coding bootcamp. Dedicating all notes here will keep all information organzied and easy to reference.

- What did you learn?
So far in the prework modules, I have learned the basics of: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
I have also learned the importance of reading supporting documentation for all the content I am applying to my website. Taking the time to slowly read through and understand what each component of the webpage is doing greatly increases my understanding.

This Study Guide Webpage is organzied into 5 sections - one of which is dedicated to JavaScript running in the Developer tools.
Each section lists key elements needed to grasp in order to have a solid foundation before starting the bootcamp.
As the class progresses, more notes and sections will be added to aid in memory retention.
