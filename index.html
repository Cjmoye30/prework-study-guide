      <h2>HTML</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML - composed of <b>elements</b> which tell the page how to be displayed. And <b>tags</b> - which define
          the
          elements.</li>
        <li>HTML code should be structured and organzied to firstly give the webpage a good foundation before proceeding
          to anything additional.</li>

        <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage. This metadata helps the browser render the
          page correctly. This is a semantic element</li>

        <li>The <b>body</b> element contains the contents of the page. This is a semantic element.</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements</b>.</li>

        <li>HTML <b>attributes</b> define additional characteristics about the elements which are alwasy defined in the
          opening tag.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS Section</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style text: inline, internal, <b>external</b>.</li>
        <li>Inline and internal are not as common and only used on a case by case basis. We will 99% of the time be
          using external - our linked CSS Styles sheet.</li>
        <li>Margin defines the space we want outside our element, while padding defines the space we want inside our
          element.</li>
        <li><b>Display: block</b> - this assigns the element to a new line on the page. Headers and paragraphs use block
          as default.</li>
        <li><b>Display: inLine</b> - text will not break onto a new line. </li>
        <li><b>Display: flex</b> - changes the inner display to flex and behave to flexbox</li>
        <li>Semantic elements (h, p, img, etc) can be declared using their normal selector to give them their values.
        </li>
        <li>Classes are defined/called by using a '.' before the class name.</li>
        <li>Multiple classes or elements can be declared by using a comma in the CSS selector</li>
        <li>...</li>

      <h3>Workflow and associated Commands</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>git status</b> - shows the current branch you're located in.</li>
        <li><b>git checkout -b feature/[name of the branch you're wanting to create]</b> - Creates a new branch.
          Necessary
          to create a branch off of your updated main branch. Common standard to always call new branches features.</li>
        <li><b>git add -A</b> - adds all modifications made to the staging area.</li>
        <li><b>git commit -m "[commit message]"</b> - Adds a commit message which must be written inside quotation
          marks.
        </li>
        <li><b>git pull origin main</b> - pulls in the most recent main branch. Important to always do this when others
          are working on the same project to have the most recent code. If not, issues can occur.</li>
        <li><b>git push origin feature/[name of the ]</b> - pushes your feature up to the main branch.</li>
        <li>Once the code has been pushed successfully, it shows in your Github dashboard as a pull request which must
          be reviewed (preferably by your colleagues) before it can be merged into the main branch.</li>
